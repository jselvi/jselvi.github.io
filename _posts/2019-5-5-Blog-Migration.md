title: Blog Migration
---

It has been a pending task in the last few years to migrate my personal blog from Blogger to Github Pages. Unfortunately I don't usually update my blog, but I think it needed a change of look and feel to motivate myself to write again.

I have decided to migrate the blogposts that I wrote in English and keep the Spanish ones in [Blogger](http://old.pentester.es) as an archive. Thus, older links don't work anymore, so if you have linked posts from this blog, please make sure that you update them.

Finally, I have decided to change the old black theme to a white one. Probably less "underground" but easier to read.

Hope you like the new format.
Thanks for reading!
